# Solar_System_Symphony
Listen to the sounds of the planets of the milkey way (of course including pluto !!!) as you warp through space between 6/1/1999 and 4/26/2021 :)  * Pitch of each planet is calculated as a function of its density. Density is mapped to a pitch within the range: (c3 130.81 - c6 1046.50)  * Amplitude modulation is based on the rotation of each planet around its own axis
